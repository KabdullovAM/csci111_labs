<h1>My Hometown: "Semei"</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semey">Semey</a>is my hometown. It is very big city with a rich history. It is original name is Semipalatinsk, which means "seven tents". Because at first it was literally 7 tents on the east side of the river. Eventually it has grown into one of the important cities in the Kazakhstan. Today </p>
<p>One of the most famous project in the whole Kazakhstan is Semey's own Semei bridge. It was build by japanese engineers more than 50 years ago. It is a bridge of a paramount importance for the citizens of the city. City itself is divided by a river. This bridge connects east and west banks of the Semey.</p>
